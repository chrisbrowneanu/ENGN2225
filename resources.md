## Tips for a Great Presentation (or Discussion) ##
There are a number of things that you can do to get your idea across:

  * Be clear and rehearse your presentation
  * Avoid using a lot of text in your slides (use your own pictures as much as possible!)
  * Reference all diagrams or data
  * Keep slides uncluttered and relevant (avoid clip art and fancy designs!!)
  * The ANU template might be a good place to start. It's available on the [Marketing website](http://www.anu.edu.au/mo/content/site2/powerpoint).
