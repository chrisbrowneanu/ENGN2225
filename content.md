### Course introduction and assessment

The Week 1 lectures will have an introduction to the course and assessment. Slides etc will be uploaded to the Slides page, and this page will remain relatively static.

The Online Classroom will be a regular feature for topics as the semester goes - these will be a short 'guide' on how to do a particular problem in the theory.

### Definition of a system

*A system is a dynamic interaction of multiple parts.*

You interact with systems every day. You might *logon* to the 'system' to find out your class schedule, you might rely on the public transport 'system' to get to your uni or work, you might even feel like sometimes you get lost in the university 'system'.

### Complex problems and Systems Engineering

*Systems Engineering as a reductionist methodology to solve complex (not-just-engineering) problems*

Complex problems are more than a modern catchphrase. Complex problems can't be reduced into pieces to find a 'neat' solution, because they are dynamic and difficult to manage. Cause-and-effect structures often mean that when one thing changes in the system, there are often unintended or unanticipated consequences. So can complexity be 'managed'? The Systems Engineer needs to operate in this complex environment, so how do they make a difference?

Understanding systems is fundamental to understanding your world. In this topic we cover some preliminary information that is core to the philosophy of this course: feedback and building a shared understanding.

### Feedback in systems

*Feedback is a widely undervalued concept. The output of a system often determines its behaviour.*

Feedback in the modern sense is often seen as a 'bad' thing. Students will relate to feedback most commonly through getting marks and comments back on assessment. This is feedback, but is usually difficult for the student to use to improve their work. Feedback in systems is a continuous process, and either balances or reinforces behaviour.

Let's use an analogy from Richardson's further reading below. Technology has enabled great advances in menial tasks, such as washing clothes. When you put the washing machine on a cycle, it stops when the cycle is over. It doesn't 'check' that the clothes are clean: it 'assumes' that the clothes are clean at the end of the cycle. There is only feedback at the end, when you hang your clothes up to dry. Compare that to the person who washes their clothes in the river. They pound, squeeze, scrub and rinse their clothes whilst continually checking the cleanliness of their clothes. This is a feedback-rich system.

What do the two approaches show us?

### Building a shared understanding

*Getting on the same page is harder than you think.*

Whenever you start any project, especially group-work, it is incredibly important to build a shared understanding of the problem you are trying to tackle. As a start, it is important to get to know the other members of your team, and to try and 'see' how they think. It is also important to carve out the problem space, by defining clear goals and objectives.

The S.M.A.R.T+ Goal framework is a simple and easy way to get your group on the same page about your goals for the project. Your S.M.A.R.T+ Goal should be one short sentence.

*  **S**: Specific
*  **M**: Measureable
*  **A**: Assignable/Attainable
*  **R**: Relevant
*  **T**: Time-related
*  **+**: Positively-framed

You will probably have different S.M.A.R.T+ goals between the members of your group, and for different aspects of your project. Get together with your group, and compare your individual S.M.A.R.T.+ goals, and then come up with a shared S.M.A.R.T.+ goal. This should be included in your Roundtable Discussions.

### SE Team and Documentation

*Documentation and teamwork - two essential ingredients to success.*

Documentation and teamwork can unravel projects if they aren't set up correctly. You should set up an approach to collaboration and documentation early and discuss how it's being used regularly.

Discuss with your team how you will address project documentation. Will you share your Mastery Task experience to help your team? Will you only share information relating to the group project? How will you share resources that might be useful to others? Will everyone have access to the final documents?

There are countless 'solutions' out there - you need to find one that's right for your team, and make sure that everyone knows how to use it. More tools can be found on Wikipedia: [Collaboration_tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_tool)

The systems engineering approach brings the voice of the customer into an engineering process. This can sometimes make the topic of systems engineering vague and difficult, but are also crucial in bringing together the various specialities within the engineering discipline.

We're covering Concept Generation this week to help with your Group Project, but typically it might sit later in the System Life-Cycle.

### Life-cycle phases

*An overview of the product life-cycle, from cradle to grave and back again.*

The product life-cycle is a model for tracking a product through different stages. A traditional product life-cycle takes a product from the extraction of the resources, through the design process, and then to the dismantling of components - the product's 'birth' to 'death', or from 'cradle' to 'grave'. New waves of thinking about resources and materials are trying to reuse completely the 'grave' resources, thus making the cycle 'cradle' to 'cradle'.

### Customer Requirements

*Translating the customer requirements into design requirements - these drive the systems engineering approach.*

Finding out what your customer wants is a great first step into the design process. You don't know what you want. As Henry Ford said ([disambiguation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford))  *"If I'd asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a faster horse"*. Customer requirements need to be translated into design requirements. This requires being very specific about what the customer needs.

### The Whats and the Hows

#### Overview

Translating the customer expectations into design requirements is a difficult process. Customers will often tell you *how* they want something (eg. "Can I get the icon in cornflower-blue") not what they *want* (eg. "I want the icon in a pleasing, yet plain colour").

You will need to translate your customer requirements into design requirements, which are neutral and can be measured.

### Use Cases

**TODO**


### System boundaries

*Where does your system (and subsystems) stop? Defining the boundaries will stop scope creep.*

Now that you've had a look at the how your system relates to the customer requirements, and how it will likely operate (FFBDs), it's time to double-check that addressing the right problem. Constructing a system boundary chart is the first step in defining what's in and out of your system.

The requirements engineering topic builds upon the basic understanding of requirements engineering that you should have covered in [ENGN1211 Discovering Engineering.](http://studyat.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN1211;details.html) Requirements engineering is an important concept, as if a system is built to the customer requirement it's likely to be more useful to the customer(!)  

### Pairwise analysis

*A tool for establishing design priorities.*

#### Overview

The pair-wise analysis is a simple tool to rank competing design requirements. Each requirement is tabulated for importance using a binary comparison. This will help your understanding of which requirements are more important than others.

#### Core resources

### Technical Performance Measures

*A tool for benchmarking designs against the design priorities.*

#### Overview

A technical performance measure becomes the key to understanding whether or not our design meets or exceeds the requirements, and competing products. Setting the TPMs or 'metrics' allows us to compare designs against a common scale.

### Quality Function Deployment - The House of Quality

*An approach for housing the design priorities, trade-offs and benchmarking.*

#### Overview

The QFD process is a way of organising and comparing the customer requirements and the design capabilities. By going through this process, we begin to see the important parts of the design and - more importantly - the relationships between the parts.

#### Note on Standards

There are many, many different ways that people use the HoQ, including symbols and lots of whacky scales. We will use numbers rather than symbols - 1: Weak, 3: Medium, 9: Strong and + positive and - negative.

### Functional analysis

*A tool for showing the functions system step-by-step.*

#### Overview

A functional analysis looks at the 'functional' steps that are required to perform an aspect of a system. In this course, we will use the traditional technique Functional Flow-Block Diagrams (FFBD) for our functional analysis. FFBDs are useful to the design process in as much as they help you to understand the intended use of the system.

FFBDs can be hierarchical, and an important part is to keep the FFBD levels at similar task size. Some blocks will have sub-functions, which can then be broken down into a sub-level.

#### Note on standards

There are also many ways to represent Functional Flow Block Diagrams (FFBDs). Please use Systems Engineering Fundamentals reading as a guiding standard.

#### Core resources

### Use Cases 2
The Use Cases topic is here again to remind groups to revisit your Use Case, as there's a good chance that your project has drifted from the original Use Case you thought of before your client meetings - it's also relevant to accurately generating your FFBDs.

### System definition and interface

*An approach for understanding the inputs and outputs of the system and subsystems.*

#### Overview

In this topic you need to define the subsystems of your design, and how they interact. Also known as a **Functional Block Diagram** (FBD), this process identifies the subsystems, and the interfaces between them. There are a few guiding principles to creating FBDs:

*  cluster the brainstormed system elements from your model boundary chart (above)
*  decide what the subsystems are (this should somewhat align with ideas from your [Functional architecture](#functional_architecture))
*  Each system and subsystem should have inputs and outputs
*  There might be external elements that the system relies on (eg. wireless transceiver)
*  You should have a description on each arrow of what is travelling (eg wireless signal, heat) and what units/standards are involved (eg 802.11n, joules)

#### Core resources

These are largely examples. Use the guide above to create your system interface diagrams. Make sure that your diagrams are clear, and have a key.

### System attributes

*Separate from the requirements described in the HoQ, the attributes are the 'qualities' of the system, categorised.*

#### Overview

The system attributes are how the system should *be*, as opposed to how a system necessarily *functions*. These might also be called the **operational functions**. These attributes are likely to be **non-functional requirements**.

A basic guide to determining the system attributes is to:

*  take your broad, top-level design requirements
*  look at how this attribute applies to your system
*  unpack these design requirements into what the customer probably *means* by selecting these requirements
*  list the sub-attributes (and sub-sub-attributes)

For example:

*  Primary attribute: robustness
  *  Secondary attribute: weatherproof
    *  Tertiary attribute: colourfast
    *  Tertiary attribute: waterproof
  *  Secondary attribute: design
    *  Tertiary attribute: shock resistant
    *  Tertiary attribute: minimise moving parts

#### Core resources

This process is fairly self-explanatory, and you can see how this manifests in the [Attributes cascade](#attributes_cascade). One way of thinking about why the customer wants particular attributes is to think about it using the 5-whys framework. You can translate this concept into the "5-hows". Using the example above - Robustness. How? Weatherproof. How? Colourfast. etc.

*  [Non-functional requirement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) this page has a number of suggestions on what non-functional attributes could derive from your design requirements.

### Attributes cascade

*The system attributes mapped to the design requirements.*

#### Overview

These take the attributes above, and then align them to the functions in your system (from the Systems architecture).

This allows you to understand how these attributes map to the system's function. For example, if a requirement changes, then it will likely change the design. Likewise, if the design changes, it might affect the requirements.

**Note**: the core reading below is a graphical representation. You could use a (nicely formatted) spreadsheet instead.

#### Core resources

*  Fourth-year project example of an Attributes Cascade [Attributes Cascade](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/wk08-ANUPDS_AttributesCascade.pdf) from an Instrumented Whitewater Slalom Gate System.
*  *Note that this is a really detailed example. It might be worthwhile considering only key attributes. Verification table unnecessary*.

Your design should be ticking along nicely at this stage. The tools to date should have informed your design to a stage where you need to think about *proving* your design. We'll do this in two ways - verifying the design, and testing. In the verification topic, we'll cover different theoretical models of testing. In the Testing topic, we'll cover hands-on methods, such as prototyping and showing a proof-of-concept. This should help you communicate the *value* of your design.

### Verification

*Demonstration that your system matches up with your requirements* 

Verification of your system is important to understand whether or not your design matches up with your requirements.

There are a number of different methods that involve testing, you should be able to identify which type of testing applies to each design attribute.

#### Core resources

*  Blanchard, B.S., W.J. Fabrycky, Systems Engineering and Analysis, Fifth ed. Pearson, New Jersey, 2011. [Testing types (pp166-171)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/wk09-Blanchard_TestingTypes.pdf)

Note that the Blanchard & Fabrycky terms can get a little confusing. A better description of the testing types is:

| Blanchard & Fabrycky Description | ENGN2225 Description |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------|
| Type 1 | Proof-of-concept testing |
| Type 2 | Model(/prototype) testing |
| Type 3 | Operational testing |
| Type 4 | Support testing |

** Further Resources **

*  [V-Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model) of Systems Engineering contains continuous validation
*  The [Attributes Cascade](#attributes_cascade) reading also contains examples of early-stage testing.

### Design evaluation

*A process for evaluating designs against the requirements.* Let's go back to the ideas that started the process - the customer requirements and the House of Quality. The ideas that we used there will help us evaluate the best design.

#### Core resources

*  [Evaluation Matrix](http://deseng.ryerson.ca/y/pub/Dcl/EvaluationMatrices.pdf) worksheet. This is a good demonstration on how you can use your customer requirements to identify the best solution.

** Further Resources **

*  Blanchard, B.S., W.J. Fabrycky, Systems Engineering and Analysis, Fifth ed. Pearson, New Jersey, 2011. [Figure 7.4 is a good way to visualise the alternatives (p202)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/wk10-Blanchard_DecisionEvaluation.pdf)

### Design selection

*A decision-process for choosing the best possible design.*

After you have gone through the Design Evaluation, the selection of the design is fairly self-evident. It's most likely that you'll pick the design that quantitatively satisfies the customer requirements.

The selection of the design isn't just about numbers. You should also consider the qualitative aspects. To this end, this topic is about revisiting the *intention* of your customer requirements, and describing how you've chosen the design that best achieves these requirements. It should also explain why you didn't choose alternatives.

We'll us the competitive, right-hand side of the HoQ to explore the selection and comparison to other products. The reading will be the same as Week 5 - House of Quality.

### Prototyping and Design Communication

*Exposing your design to the real-world.*

#### Overview

Prototyping is one of the most important things to communicate your idea. This could be a physical artefact, sketches, demonstrations - anything to help show how your idea will work.

#### Core resources

*  [Rapid prototyping Google Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rapid%20prototyping%20Google%20Glass) - Tom Chi goes through how they prototyped Google glass.

Tom's Prototyping Rules:

1.  Find the quickest path to experience
1.  Doing is the best kind of thinking
1.  Use materials that move at the *speed of thought* to maximise your rate of learning

**Question: how is this similar to the way that you learn?**

#### Online Classroom

*There's no online classroom for this topic - Tom Chi does a great job showing how to communicate your design through the rapid prototyping in the core reading above.*

** Further Resources **

There are a bunch of ideas around prototypes. Spend some time on YouTube to find out what might be suitable for communicating your idea :)
