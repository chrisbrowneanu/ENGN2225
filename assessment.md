# Assessment

This course focusses on developing a critical approach to problem solving using systems engineering methodologies in a team-based environment. Different people learn in different ways, and the experience of the assessment will be slightly different for each student. This is reflected (somewhat) in the design of assessment below.

Note that Tutorial and Lab attendance carry no weight, but are offered as valuable opportunities to improve your understanding of topics.

Please note that your individual Due Dates (i.e. Jigsaw Tasks) will be available in WATTLE after the Week 2 tutorial.

Please familiarise yourself with the extensions policy of the Research School of Engineering (see the [Course Policies section on the front page](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/#course_rules_and_policies) or go to the Undergraduate Portal in WATTLE)

## Feedback

Feedback is the most important part of developing your work. Feedback can be formal -  with your teaching staff - but can also come in all sorts of places - attending the labs, your group work, your peers, former students, at the pub, from your family, etc. You should seek and engage feedback before due dates to **feed-in** to your assessed work. 

As feedback once you've handed your work in doesn't necessarily help your mark, written feedback will generally be minimal and will be provided to justify a mark. We encourage you to talk to your tutor before submitting work so that you can get feedback ahead of submission.

## Generalised Criteria

There are detailed criteria for each assessment piece. However, John Biggs' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy is a useful framework for thinking about your work. In this course, where the tasks are often open-ended, students are especially encouraged to operate in the Relational and Extended Abstract domains of the taxonomy.

We will talk about this during classes and meetings, but if you have any questions please raise them.

# Group Project Guide

Solve a design problem for a real-world client.

## Task 1: Roundtable 1 + PCD
<img src="http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/current/data/images/engn-group.png" title="Group Project Flow" class="right">
Present a short scoping document for your design problem that you can take to client meetings. Note that you are not bound to these ideas, and it is expected that they will evolve over the semester.

### Task Requirements
Present a written 2-page Project Concept Document (PCD), and lead a 10-minute discussion/presentation/roundtable. You may use slides if you need to to help the discussion (for example, a picture of alternative designs). The PCD should include aspects in the template, including:

*  Project title, client, mentor, members
*  A Use Case for the problem
*  Potential Designs or Design Ideas, including a review of existing designs
*  Identification of stakeholders and potential collaborators
*  A plan for completing the design task, including the identification of potential issues

The template can be modified as necessary. Use it as a guide.

*  Download the PCD template ([Word docx)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_concept_document.docx)) ([Apple Pages](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_concept_document.pages.zip)) ([OpenOffice.org](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_concept_document.odt))

### Feedback
No marks are allocated to this assessment piece, but you will receive feedback from the group and your tutor guide the start of your project.

  * Demonstrate that the ideas address the design problem
  * Feasibility of the ideas
  * Quality and professionalism of discussion

### Submission
Please come to your tutorial with presentations, and 10 copies of your PCD to share around the room. Please also submit a soft copy on WATTLE.

## Client Meetings
Each group will have the opportunity to meet with their clients to expand on their PCD. Please take your PCD to your client meeting (and be prepared to change your whole ideas around your project!).

## Task 2: Weekly Progress Report
The draft project report is a document that you will build with your group each week over the semester. The final report will be given to the client, and should be a representation of your group's best work over the semester.

There are two parts to the weekly submissions at your tutorial:

  - Progress document
  - Group homework

### Progress Document

The weekly progress document is a 'control' document that demonstrates your group's progress, and highlights any issues that your group might be having. Please bring a copy each week, and bring previous weeks' reports too. Develop this in consultation with your tutor.

*  Download the Weekly Progress template ([Word docx)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_weekly_progress.docx)) ([Apple Pages](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_weekly_progress.pages.zip)) ([OpenOffice.org](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_weekly_progress.odt)) 

### Group Homework

The weekly homework exercise should be 1-2 pages and eventually build into the Final Report. The weekly homework exercises should be completed as a group, but should have strong links to the Individual Research Paper on that topic. Prepare your homework exercise for each tutorial, but your group may choose to improve and develop these ideas during the semester for the Final Report.
  
Each week, apply a relevant technique to the topic in relation to your group project. For example, in Week 5:

*  The weekly topic is Requirements Engineering
*  If my project was, for example, an Electric Car, I could complete a House of Quality comparing alternative designs

You could use the following template, or evolve your own. Homework should be of a high standard:

*  Download the Weekly Homework template ([Word docx)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_homework.docx)) ([Apple Pages](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_homework.pages.zip)) ([OpenOffice.org](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/project_homework.odt))

### Marking Criteria

Each week, your group will have a meeting with your tutor to report group progress. In the Week 10 tutorial, you will be asked to give a peer evaluation of this exercise over the entire semester, which will moderate individual marks.

The criteria are open-ended to match the differing nature of the group projects:

*  Technical demonstration of a whole-of-system approach throughout the systems engineering design process
*  Use of a systems approach improve design outcomes or operational performance for the real-world problem
*  Concise communication and documentation, in particular the generation of clear engineering specification documents

### Submission
Weekly Homework/Progress Report submission should be made weekly in your tutorial group to your tutor. Submit at the beginning of the tutorial, and your tutor will meet with you in the second hour. Note that this exercise doubles as preparation for your tutorial, and should be completed as a group. A hard copy is required of both the Progress Document and the Weekly Exercise. Submissions should include previous weeks' submissions (ie. it should build up each week).  

## Task 3: Presentation + FPR

The Final Project should be an accumulation of the knowledge developed over the semester, and will be made available to the project clients at the conclusion of the course.

The final report should be a professional, coherent compilation of the improved weekly homework of no more than 15 pages (excluding bibliography or appendices). There is no template for this final report (your group should develop your own).

*  Final Project Report (10%)
*  Roundtable Presentation at end of semester (5%)

Your final presentation should show your group's learning over the entire semester. You will have 15 minutes to use as you wish. It is strongly recommended that you present for no more than 10 minutes, and then facilitate an activity for the remainder of the time (such as those that you might have done in the tutorials). Anything goes.

### Marking Criteria

Both the report and presentation have the common criteria, weighted equally:

*  Technical demonstration of a whole-of-system approach throughout the systems engineering design process
*  Use of a systems approach improve design outcomes or operational performance for the real-world problem
*  Concise communication and documentation, in particular the generation of clear engineering specification documents
  
### Submission
Please submit a soft copy of your report on WATTLE prior to the start of your tutorial, and bring a hard copy for your tutor to mark. 

# Jigsaw Tasks

The [Jigsaw Classroom explained](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAjjC8YwCbc) in a video (11 min).

## Tutorial Facilitation Guide

<img src="http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/current/data/images/engn-tutorial.png" title="Tutorial Facilitation Flow" class="right">

In this activity, you're being asked to become a (relative) expert in your topic, and then co-facilitate the topic to your peers in groups of (approximately) four. 

There are three components to this assessment piece. As a topic facilitator, you will lead the development of the weekly homework for your group along with the person doing their Individual Research Paper. These activities tie in together strongly.

The stages for this assessment piece are:

  * Workshop Ticket + Theory Workshop
  * Secret Plan (5%)
  * Tutorial Co-Facilitation (10%)

You will pick your facilitation topic in the Week 2/3 tutorials.

If you are interested on how 'student-facilitated' tutorials came into this course, I stole them from [ANU Professor Richard Baker](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/baker-rm). You can read [his paper on the idea on his personal webpage](http://fennerschool-people.anu.edu.au/richard_baker/teaching/webpapers/supertut/index.html). 

### Workshop Ticket + Theory Workshop
This activity is run by Chris, and will guide you through important aspects of the theory and of running a good tutorial. You'll also work with your co-facilitators on how you're going to run your tutorial.

#### Preparation
As preparation for the Workshop, please post to the Workshop Ideas Forum before attending. 

The question is a response to: *"How could you effectively teach this topic?" Please make reference to a relevant case study, activity or other suitable resources.*

**This workshop and preparation is not marked, but is compulsory. If you cannot attend the workshop, then you will not be allowed to facilitate the topic, and will be given a mark of 0% for the Co-Facilitation.**

#### Task Overview
We'll go through aspects of:

*  what are the important theory components that you should cover
*  what makes a good/bad tutorial
*  how should you structure your tutorial, and what you need to prepare

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to report:

*  an outline of your 'secret' facilitation plan, including activities and timings
*  a shared SMART+ Goal (a goal in one-sentence that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely and Positive)
*  a shared relevant Engineering Case study that you can use to help tutorial members engage with the topic

#### Submission
Attendance will be recorded to ensure that all co-facilitators have completed the activity.

### Tutorial Co-Facilitation and Secret Plan
This is the actual facilitation during your tutorial slot. Your tutor will act as a guide if necessary, and will mark your facilitation during the session.

#### Task Overview

*  your Secret Plan should be a 1-page 'agenda' of the facilitation, including activities, allocation of roles and fall-back options (note you do not need to stick strictly to the plan, but it should provide a good 'back-bone' to your facilitation.
*  your facilitation should run for 60 minutes (should finish on the hour).
*  you should cover the topics for the week in an interesting and relevant way, with an emphasis on building on the homework
*  your group can expect that everyone has at least done the tutorial homework for their group project (see Weekly Group Exercise)

#### Marking Criteria
You will receive a group mark for this assessment item, which will be moderated by your co-facilitators if necessary. There are two marks awarded: 10% for the facilitation, and 5% for your completed Secret Plan.

Your group will be marked by your tutor according to the following criteria:

  * encourages participation of all tutorial members
  * extent to which the facilitators build a shared understanding of the theory
  * extends the topic through the use of an engineering case study
  * clear, logical progression of ideas which leads to an effective conclusion

#### Resources
Chris will give you a handout throughout the tutorial specific to your week's topic. You can download a [basic version of this workshop handout.](assessment/workshopplain.pdf)

#### Submission and Feedback
You must give a hard copy of your Secret Plan to your tutor at the beginning of your tutorial. Your tutor will mark the facilitation throughout the tutorial, and will offer initial feedback and allow peer feedback. Your group will get written feedback and marks at the following tutorial.

## Research Paper Guide

Investigate your content topic in relation to your group project topic. <img src="http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/current/data/images/engn-research.png" title="Research Paper Flow" class="right">

The research paper is submitted over a number of weeks to get to a well-developed final paper.

*  Monday 10am, one week before the topic - submit a Structured Abstract (5%)
*  Monday 10am, week of topic - submit a Draft for Peer Review with Turnitin report (the more complete the better)
*  Friday 10am, one week after topic - submit a final paper and Peer Review Critique (20%)

### Structured Abstract
This activity is designed to give you early feedback on your thinking in the individual Research Paper. It can also help preparation for your group's homework.

#### Task Requirements
The Research Paper is an application of the topic theory to your project. This Structured Abstract should be a 'proposal' of how you plan to do this. It should include:

*  a relevant title and author details
*  a short description of how the theory could be applied to your group's design problem. *This could be dot-points, diagrams with captions, or text*
  *  the template suggests a few sentences on: *Context, Purpose or Goal, Approach, Actual or Anticipated Outcomes, Conclusions/Recommendations/Summary, References*
*  at least three additional academic references that you will use, including a rationale explaining why it is a relevant resource (resources should not be listed on the topic's page)

Submission must be by PDF, and the outline must not exceed two A4 pages. If you have a draft table, schematic or diagram, you may attach it on an additional page - but please pose a question for feedback with it.

Please use the Structured Abstract template. You may alter and adjust if necessary.

*  Download the Structured Abstract template ([Word docx)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/structured_abstract.docx)) ([Apple Pages](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/structured_abstract.pages.zip)) ([OpenOffice.org](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/structured_abstract.odt)) ([LateX](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/structured_abstract.zip))

#### Marking Criteria
All criteria have equal weight.

  * Demonstration that the task requirements have been met
  * Take a whole-of-system approach when discussing the design
  * Detailed understanding of the systems engineering theory
  * Demonstration of systems theory to improve design outcomes or operational performance
  * Quality and relevance of bibliography

#### Submission
Submission is required by 10am Monday the week before the topic. A small amount of written feedback and mark will given via WATTLE. You can access more feedback from Chris by coming to a Lab session.

### Individual Research Paper or Poster
The Individual Research Paper gives depth to your Group Project Report (note that it is expected that projects will evolve, and that this relationship might decouple).

#### Task Requirements
The Individual Research Paper should be a case study application of the theory to your project.

This paper should include:

*  a relevant title
*  author details
*  a short abstract (150 words) to orientate the reader to your topic and your design problem
*  evidence of how the theory has been applied in previous situations (a short Literature Review)
*  relevant diagrams/analyses to help illustrate the argument (this may well be your group's homework, but not necessarily)
*  an application/discussion of the theory topic to your project
*  a bibliography including high-quality references, using the Harvard referencing system
*  **a half-page 'critique'** of the Peer Review comments you received from your Draft (not included in your word count)

Submission must be by PDF. The research paper content should not exceed 1,500 words and be between 4-5 pages, not including the bibliography. You could include calculations/extended diagrams in an Appendix, but please don't expect the Appendix to be read (i.e. - put anything important in the paper).

Please use the Individual Research Paper template. You may alter and adjust if necessary.

*  Download the Research Paper template ([Word docx)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/individual_research_paper.docx)) ([Apple Pages](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/individual_research_paper.pages.zip)) ([OpenOffice.org](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/individual_research_paper.odt)) ([LateX](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/individual_research_paper.zip))

#### Submission
**Draft: ** submission on WATTLE by 10am Monday, the week of the topic. This is to allow time for the Peer Reviewers to provide comments by Friday of the topic week. A Turnitin report should be submitted with the Draft to help the reviewers confirm that your content is original.
**Final: ** submission on WATTLE by 10am Friday, the week after the topic. Your research paper will be marked by your tutor.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Peer Review
You will be allocated two Individual Research Papers to Peer Review. This should assist the author improve their thinking about their paper, and hopefully your own.

### Task Requirements
Read the author's paper, and complete a short questionnaire to assist the author improve.
### Marking Criteria
You will be awarded a mark for each of the two peer reviews you complete. You will receive a mark on how useful the peer review was for the author against the folllowing criteria:

*  extent to which your comments will help the author improve their paper content
*  extent of constructive comments that respect the author's perspectives

### Submission
Submission will be available on WATTLE - please complete the activity there. (Should take less than 30 minutes if you're across the content.)

# System Design Portfolio
Take a system or design, and improve it using systems engineering techniques.<img src="http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/current/data/images/engn-portfolio.png" title="Portfolio Flow" class="right">

The System Design Portfolio is an opportunity for individuals to showcase their understanding and extension of themes and concepts in the course.

**As much as possible, you should look for a technology theme that you can get hands-on with. Think of using the 'Think, Plan, Do, Invent' loops to demonstrate your learning (teardowns, builds, repairs, reflections encouraged!)**

### Portfolio Scoping Plan
A hardcopy needs to be signed-off by Chris in the weeks 5-7 Labs.

*  Download the Porfolio Scoping template ([Word docx)](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/portfolio_plan.docx)) ([Apple Pages](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/portfolio_plan.pages.zip)) ([OpenOffice.org](http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/course-files/templates/portfolio_plan.odt))

### Task Requirements

There is no clear format for this assessment piece. Creativity and insights based on applications are encouraged. You should use the weekly group homework as a starting point, but you're not restricted to a report. Talk to Chris to discuss and navigate your approach to this assessment piece if you are unsure.

The Portfolio should:

*  have a common technology theme<br />*You should not choose a theme or topic that is a copy of your group project. You could, however, laterally explore technologies to inform your project if you wish. Most importantly, you should choose a technology that interests you.*
*  contain insightful analysis that demonstrates your understanding of the course content<br />*You should present a document that demonstrates the holistic systems engineering process for your technology.*
*  be a professional representation (if you're writing a report, it should be of **12-15 pages** excluding the bibliography, developed over the semester). However, if you would like to present your portfolio in an alternative format, please raise this with Chris in the Labs before Week 7.

**You should include theory from weeks 5-10 in your porfolio to demonstrate a complete understanding of the course content.** However, if there's a topic that doesn't fit, you should explain why or talk to Chris to find an extension topic.

### Marking Criteria
This is a significant part of the course mark. To benefit different learning styles and differentiate understanding of course concepts, there are three aspects to this submission:

*  Portfolio artefact (20%)<br />*i.e. the document*
*  Portfolio discussion and defence (10%)<br />*A 10-min walkthrough of your document, which will include questions and answers of aspects of your Portfolio.*

Both assessment items will be marked using the following criteria:

*  Technical demonstration of a whole-of-system approach throughout the systems engineering design process
*  Use of a systems approach improve design outcomes or operational performance for the real-world problem
*  Concise communication and documentation, in particular the generation of clear engineering specification documents
*  Quality and relevance of the bibliography

### Submission
You need to have your Portfolio Scoping Plan signed off by Chris in the weeks 5-7 labs.

Please submit a PDF of your Portfolio on WATTLE, and sign up for a Week 13 discussion spot on WATTLE from Week 10.
