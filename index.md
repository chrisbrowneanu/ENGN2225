# Course Guide <a id="Course_Guide"></a>

ENGN2225 Systems Engineering Design fits into the Professional stream of the [BEng degree](http://studyat.anu.edu.au/programs/4700XBENG;requirements.html), and is compulsory for students in that degree program.

System Engineering is an engineering methodology used to solve detailed, large and otherwise unmanageable projects and problems over their entire life-time. In this course we build on ENGN1211 Discovering Engineering, and use systems engineering tools to solve a 'relatively simple' design problem for a real-world client.

There is no 'defined' process for systems engineering, but it should rather be seen as a set of tools used in combination to improve processes and outcomes. Classic examples of systems engineering processes are NASA's Apollo program and the International Space Station, and Toyota's manufacturing system. Systems engineering principles are applicable to any process (eg, manufacturing, mining, technology development, business, ... ) and systems engineers are employed in a vast range of industries.

Aspects in ENGN2225 lead into ENGN2226, but students can seek permission to do these courses out of sequence with minimal disruption.

## Course Outline 

The course uses multiple learning methods to develop students' ability to meet the Learning Outcomes, and Engineers Australia graduate competencies. These are detailed on the course's page on [StudyAt](http://studyat.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225;details.html).

**Variation to StudyAt Entry** Please note that the indicative assessment is different to that confirmed in the [Assessment](#Assessment) section, and that there **is NO textbook** for this course (or for ENGN2225). All extra resources will be available on this site.

## Learning Activities 

<img src="http://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/ENGN2225/current/data/images/engn-course.png" title="Course Flow" class="right">

**Face-to-face Activities**

*  **Lectures** - Lectures will be in weeks 1, 2, 3 and 11 to orientate st
*  **Labs** - to consolidate the week's topic content, there will be a 'hardware' lab run by your lecturer. Bring your laptop, and expect to participate. These are voluntary and assessment-free (just like a lecture). A creative, hands-on, systems engineering challenge will be the focus of each lab. 
*  **Tutorials** - Weeks 2-4 will have tutor-facilitated tutorials, which will provide an example for student-facilitated tutorials
*  **Student-Facilitated Tutorials** - Weeks 5-10 will have student-facilitated tutorials. Every student will co-facilitate a tutorial of 60 minutes to their peers. Tutorial attendance is highly recommended, as non-facilitating students will be asked to engage in the material in a number of ways.
*  **Group mentoring** - tutors will act as mentors for your group project work, and will meet with you in weeks 5-10.

**Online Activities**

*  **Online Lecturettes** - technical content will be provided through course videos and resources available on the [Course Content](content) pages
*  **Self-tests and further resources** - each lecturette will have a self-test to make sure that you're on the right track, and further resources to explore the topic
*  **Research and Peer Review** - facilitating students will work towards a research paper applying their project to their facilitation topic. Participating students will provide peer review comments twice throughout the semester on research papers.

## Expected Workload 

You are expected to engage in the course and the materials for approximately **10 hours per week**.

*  **Lectures** - 2 x 1 hours (weeks 1, 2, 3, 11)
*  **Tutorials** - 2 hours (weeks 2-12)
*  **Labs** - 2 hours (weeks 5-10)
*  **Workshop** - twice in the semester, 2 hours (weeks 4-9)
*  **Group Project work** - at least 2 hours per week outside tutorials is expected
*  **Individual Research** - 4 hours per week is expected, to cover the course material, extended research and individual tasks

It is expected that you will attend all tutorials - they are the most important part of the course. Tutorials - especially the ones run by your peers - are VERY difficult with low attendance, so please ensure that you can attend throughout the semester. 

Labs are hands-on and will not be recorded, but any relevant notes will be made available. If you are unable to attend, please email Chris or your tutor to let them know. This is a common courtesy. You can expect feedback very promptly in this course - usually at the next session.

## Indicative Assessment 

This course focusses on developing group problem-solving skills, and a critical approach to problem solving using systems engineering methodologies. Different people learn in different ways, and accordingly the experience of the assessment will be slightly different for each student, especially in the Portfolio. Please see the [Assessment](assessment) scheme for the information.

Feedback is a process which is widely and fundamentally misunderstood. Marks are a key driver for students in courses, but feedback also ***drives*** systems. Unlike the mark, feedback shouldn't be an output or end result. Feedback on each task will be given within one week in most cases, to help you prepare for the next task. You should think of this 'feedback' as an input to your next learning task. 


## Learning Outcomes 

**Knowledge Base:**

1. Gather a list of appropriate and meaningful customer needs and translate these into technical engineering requirements and performance measures
1. Break down a system with a defined top-level function into a number of appropriate sub- functions for further engineering development and integration into other subsystems
1. Take a whole-of-system approach throughout the systems engineering design process

**Engineering ability:**

1. Apply the systems engineering design process to a real-world problem
1. Use a systems approach improve design outcomes and operational performance
1. Iterate through design cycles to improve practical prototypes and mock-ups

**Practical skills:**

1. Interact with clients and stakeholders in a team-based project to deliver a relevant design outcome
1. Undertake research in systems engineering topics and share this research with peers
1. Generate concise documentation, in particular the generation of clear engineering specification documents
  
## Group Work & Peer Evaluation 

Peer evaluation and comments are a part of group work: in this case, the Group Project and Tutorial Facilitation.

Sometimes not all members of a group contribute equally to the the work required, or not all members have the same expectations of standards. There is a moderation process available to provide recognition where it is required:

*  Tutorial Co-facilitation **voluntary**  
*talk to your tutor upon the completion of your tutorial if your group requires this*
*  Group Project **required**  
*this will occur in the week 12 tutorial. Moderation will apply to all group project assessment, unless otherwise stated by the group (eg, person A helped a lot during semester, but we didn't see them whilst preparing the final reports)*

The course convener will override group evaluation if deemed necessary, in consultation with your tutor. This highlights the importance of working well both as a group, and within your group.

## Course Rules and Policies 

As this course is run out of the Research School of Engineering, the relevant rules around word limits, late penalties and special consideration will be applied.

**If you have any issues, please talk to Chris early.**

[You can find College information on Assessment, Exams and Appeals on the Student Portal on WATTLE](http://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/mod/page/view.php?id=272190).

### Examiner's Discretion 
The course convener has examiner's discretion on your final grade. For ENGN2225, in principle, no discretion will be exercised unless you are close to a grade boundary - for example, you get 69.5% as a final grade. If you are in this scenario, the course convener will review your individual assessment items and make a decision based on these data. The course convener's decision is final, though you are entitled to appeal your grade according to the [Engineering Handbook](http://wattlearchive.anu.edu.au/mod/resource/view.php?id=421274.html)

If you do have a problem with marks for individual assessment items please:

1. talk to the marker (usually your tutor)
  *  your marker will provide further comments or clarification if needed
1. if you are still unhappy with the marker's response, you can:
  *  ask the course convener to re-mark the assessment - this requires a couple of dot points outlining how your work should be seen against the marking criteria
  *  ask the course convener if you can resubmit (Individual Research Paper ONLY) - this requires negotiation with the course convener
1. if you are unhappy with the course convener's response, you can appeal to the academic dean (in consultation with the course convener) as described in the [Engineering Handbook](http://wattlearchive.anu.edu.au/mod/resource/view.php?id=421274.html)
